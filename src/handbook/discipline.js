        <p className="p3"><span className="s1">Trying to keep 30 to 50 teenage boys orderly and out of harm's way is a challenge. We want Scouting to be fun and we want meetings to be a comfortable place to spend time. We ask that parents and adult mentors assist us in conveying a few simple concepts. Please take a moment to review the following points with your Scout:</span></p>
        <p className="p4"><span className="s1">a. We maintain a ZERO tolerance on physical abuse. No hitting, shoving, pushing, kicking, or other aggressive physical contact is allowed.</span></p>
        <p className="p4"><span className="s1">b. Teasing, belittling, harassing, or taunting another Scout, older or younger, is not in keeping with Scout spirit and is not allowed.</span></p>
        <p className="p4"><span className="s1">c. Disrespect of any kind is not in keeping with Scout spirit, and disrespect to an adult leader or to Scouts in leadership positions is especially discomforting. Disrespect or irreverence during flag ceremonies is completely unacceptable.</span></p>
        <p className="p5">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p3"><span className="s1">Each and every person involved in the Troop deserves to have a positive experience. At times a formal "Code of Conduct", or a signed "contract" between Scout and Troop may become necessary, but we hope that a reinforcement of the rules by parents -- a united front and a consistent message -- will cause Scouts to take heed.</span></p>
        <p className="p5">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p3"><span className="s1">Should we continue to observe a Scout violating these standards at meetings or other gatherings, the Troop leadership will contact the Scout&rsquo;s parents at the time of the infraction so that the situation can be discussed at a more convenient time. If the problem cannot be resolved in any other way, it will be referred to the Troop Committee for final action.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Thank you in advance for your assistance and support.</span></p>
