The Patrol will function better with each Scout&rsquo;s help. Remember that each boy is an important part of the Patrol. By combining all of the different talents, abilities, and efforts of each Scout, the Patrol becomes effective and powerful. Patrols are encouraged to have activities separate from the troop meeting.</span></p>

        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">A Patrol will be made up of at least four Scouts. Any new Scouts joining the Troop will have someone in the Patrol to help welcome and make them feel comfortable. Everyone in the Patrol should have a duty.

        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">The boy leaders under the supervision and assistance of adults run the Troop. The Troop Committee picks the Scoutmaster whose primary job is to teach leadership skills to the boy leaders of the Troop. The Senior Patrol Leader is in charge of the Troop and facilities all its meetings and activities. In his absence, the Assistant Senior Patrol Leader takes his place. The Patrol Leaders run their Patrol. Other members of the troop such as the Librarian or Quarter Master may also have special assignments. Each boy leader represents the members of the Troop who have elected them.</span></p>
        <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Each year elections are held to choose the Troop leadership. This is the time for the scout voice to be heard on who they wish to lead them. Decisions are made by majority vote. Even if the individual the scout wanted did not win the election, he has an obligation to let the majority rule and support the individual elected. If at any time the elected scout is unable to fulfill his leadership responsibility. A suitable replacement may be put in place. </span></p>
        <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">After the annual elections, the new Patrol Leader will ask for input on the types of activities in which the patrol would like to participate in during the next year. It is important that the scout gives their input so that the Patrol Leader can represent the scout's interest at the Annual Troop Planning Meeting. At this meeting, the Troop Leaders Council will by determining the Troop Program for the coming year. The Patrol Leader will report the results of this meeting to the Patrol. As with elections, Scouts have an obligation to support the decisions of the Council, knowing that the elected Patrol Leader represented your interests.</span></p>
        <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Except in unusual circumstances, if a Scout has a question or problem, it should be addressed to his Patrol Leader. If he cannot get help, then he should speak to the Senior Patrol Leader first and then the Scoutmaster. The next step is the Troop Committee Chair. Remember that there are also other individuals with specific jobs, for example, if a Scout needs a Merit Badge book, he should talk to the librarian; or if he needs troop equipment, he should talk to the Quartermaster.</span></p>
