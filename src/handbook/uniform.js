The Troop Committee can offer suggestions on how to earn money for the boy to obtain a full uniform.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The Troop does have a uniform bank. These uniforms may be used for a fee of $5.00. We only ask that the uniform be returned once the Scout has outgrown it so that it may be used by another scout. Donations of Scout uniforms are greatly appreciated.</span></p>

        <p className="p7"><span className="s1">Class E &ndash; Same as Class A except that a Scout can wear all of his merit badges, ribbons, beads, and other special scouting awards all at the same time. This uniform is worn only during a Court of Honor and other special events, as specified by the Scout Master or SPL.</span></p>
