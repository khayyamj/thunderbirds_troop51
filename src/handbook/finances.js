        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">The cost of camp includes the cost set by the specific camp chosen, as well as the cost of getting there. The Troop Committee will make a determination in the winter as to the cost of Summer Camp for the following year. While some fundraising opportunities will be provided by the Troop to help with the cost of camp, the Scout is responsible for raising the funds necessary to pay for camp. If you know in advance that your scout will need help with the summer camp fees, opportunities may be available for them to earn the money needed.</span></p>

          <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Scouting costs money.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In addition to registration fees, are the costs associated with equipment, supplies, repairs, maintenance, transportation, Courts of Honor, patches, awards, and campouts. To keep expenses down to a manageable level the Troop sponsors at least one major fundraising activity a year.&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
          <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Because these activities are labor intensive, parental or guardian participation is required. </span></p>
          <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
          <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Each Scout will have a personal account with the Troop for the moneymaking activities in which he participates. The Troop Committee will decide the amount of money the Scout can earn on each event. Money earned through a troop fundraiser can be used for any Scout activity. Such funds cannot be provided to you in cash and will not be refunded if you leave the Troop. With Committee approval, funds in a personal account may be used for Scout uniforms or equipment purchases. </span></p>
          <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
          <p className="p5"><span className="s1">A Scout is encouraged to help with fundraisers, but should not expect to earn all his money this way. He should plan to do other things to raise money. Remember that a &ldquo;Scout pays his own way.&rdquo; Whenever possible, a Scout should not depend on parents, guardians or others to pay the cost of Scouting for him. Rather, he should be encouraged to pay as much of his own way as possible.</span></p>
