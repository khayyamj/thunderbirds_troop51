        <p className="p2">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p3"><span className="s1"><strong>The Scout Handbook</strong></span></p>
        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">A Scout makes a continued effort to advance toward the rank of Eagle. He will bring his Scout Handbook to each meeting so he can pass off requirements as they are earned. He is a self-starter. He may use parents or other adults to help him learn scouting skills outside of the Troop Meetings or activities.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Advancements through First Class must be passed off at scout meetings or scout campouts by a Troop 51 scout who is two ranks above the rank they are working on.</span></p>
        <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p3"><span className="s1"><strong>Neckerchief</strong></span></p>
        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">As soon as a Scout joins the troop and has a full uniform, he will be given a plain orange neckerchief.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Once he has completed his Tenderfoot rank, he will be presented a neckerchief with the Troop Thunderbird logo. If he is transferring from another troop, he will need to:</span></p>
        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p7"><span className="s1">Show that he can perform the same tasks as a Troop 51 Scout that has achieved the rank of Tenderfoot </span></p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1"><span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>AND obtain a rank advancement</span></p>
        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">(The Scoutmaster can make an exception to these rules.)</span></p>
        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">The neckerchief is on loan to the Scout. Once he receives the rank of Eagle the neckerchief is given to him. Likewise, if the Scout moves away the troop can vote for the boy to keep it. At any time if a Scout is not following the Scout Oath, Law, Motto and Slogan; or if he is disrespectful to his neckerchief or to the Troop, the Scout Masters Council can vote to take it away and replace it with a plain orange neckerchief until the Scout can show he deserves to wear the Thunderbird neckerchief.</span></p>
        <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p3"><span className="s1"><strong>Merit Badges</strong></span></p>
        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Merit Badge Process:</span></p>
        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p8"><span className="s1">1. Check with Merit badge coordinator to find merit badge counselor</span></p>
        <p className="p8"><span className="s1">2. See Scoutmaster to obtain a blue card</span></p>
        <p className="p8"><span className="s1">3. Contact merit badge counselor and complete Workbook</span></p>
        <p className="p8"><span className="s1">4. Work with the merit badge counselor to complete requirements</span></p>
        <p className="p8"><span className="s1">5. Once completed pass off with Scoutmaster</span></p>
        <p className="p9">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p8"><span className="s1">A boy cannot have the same merit badge counselor for more than 4 merit badges in a 12 month period.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Remember, a parent or guardian can be a merit badge counselor for his/her own Scout if they are teaching the same merit badge to two or more unrelated scouts. Furthermore, while you may suggest an individual as a potential Merit Badge Counselor, that individual must understand his/her duties, be registered with the Scout Office.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>If a scout wishes to complete a merit badge with a person who is not affiliated with Troop 51 (such as pow-wows, youth activities etc) the Merit Badge worksheet </span><span className="s3">must</span><span className="s1"> be turned in with the blue card for approval.</span></p>
        <p className="p9">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p8"><span className="s1">Boys should not meet with a Merit Badge Counselor alone. They must have a guardian or other adult present.</span></p>
        <p className="p9">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p8"><span className="s1">**<em>If you know someone who would like to be a merit badge counselor, PLEASE give their information to the Merit badge coordinator. That way we can increase our counselor pool.</em></span></p>
        <p className="p9">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p3"><span className="s1"><strong>Attendance</strong></span></p>

        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">(The Scoutmaster can make an exception to these rules. When extenuating circumstances exist.)</span></p>
        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p3"><span className="s1"><strong>Scoutmaster Conference</strong></span></p>
        <p className="p10">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Once a Scout has completed all requirements for a rank advancement the scout should contact the Scoutmaster for a Scoutmaster&rsquo;s Conference. The purpose of the Conference is to reinforce Scouting Values and to ensure the Scout is ready for advancement.</span></p>
        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p3"><span className="s1"><strong>Board of Review</strong></span></p>
        <p className="p10">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">A Board of Review is composed of at least two Troop Committee members or parents. Its purpose is to ensure that the Scout has completed all requirements for advancement.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>His Patrol Leader will present him to the Board. </span></p>
        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">There are a number of things he must know to pass a Board of Review including the following:</span></p>

If a Scout feels that he cannot wait for a regularly scheduled Board of Review he should tell his Scoutmaster.</span></p>
        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p3"><span className="s1"><strong>Eagle Project</strong></span></p>
        <p className="p11">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Once a Scout reaches Life Rank he should contact the Troop 51 Eagle coach who will assist him with his paperwork.</span></p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">It should be noted that all Eagle Projects must be pre-approved by the Scoutmaster, the Troop Committee chair of Troop 51. The Scout must initiate the project and </span><span className="s3">do all</span><span className="s1"> the planning. This is </span><span className="s3"><strong>HIS</strong></span><span className="s1"> project, not the parents.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p3"><span className="s1"><strong>Parents/Guardian Role</strong></span></p>
        <p className="p10">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Parents or guardians can have a significant role in encouraging scouting advancement. They should ask how the Scout is doing and be aware of what he is working on. Periodically, they should review the Scout Handbook to see what has been signed off. </span></p>
        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1"><strong>A PARENT OR GUARDIAN CANNOT SIGN OFF IN THE HANDBOOK.</strong> </span></p>
        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">If a parent or guardian knows what Merit Badge a young man is working on he/she can help obtain the Merit Badge book. In addition, there is a book available that lists all of the Merit Badge and rank advancement requirements. Going through this book periodically with the Scout can spark current interests.</span></p>
        <p className="p12">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">When invited, a parent or guardian can show interest by participating in Troop activities.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Please remember, however, that no adult who is not in full uniform may address the Troop unless he/she is an invited guest speaker.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>As a guest, they should not intervene unless invited to do so by the appropriate Scout Leader.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>As such, while parents may certainly stay during meetings, we ask that they wait in an adjoining room and keep extra siblings under control so as to not cause a distraction.</span></p>
        <p className="p10">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p3"><span className="s1"><strong>Recognition</strong></span></p>

        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p13"><span className="s1"><strong>Court of Honor</strong></span></p>
        <p className="p14">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Unless there are special circumstances, Courts of Honor will be held once every three months.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Parents, relatives, and friends should be invited to the Courts of Honor. All Scouts attending a Court of Honor should come in full &ldquo;Class E&rdquo; uniform. As a Scout joins the troop, with each rank advancement he will be expected to take an oath reaffirming his commitment to the Scout law, Oath and Promise.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>An Eagle Court of Honor should be done by the Eagle scout&rsquo;s family, with support from the troop and the committee.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>It can be held either with the troop court of honor or separately </span></p>
        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p13"><span className="s1"><strong>Activity Beads</strong></span></p>
        <p className="p14">&nbsp;</p>
