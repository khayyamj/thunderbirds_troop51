       <p className="p2">&nbsp;</p>
       <p className="p3"><span className="s1">The purpose of Troop 51 is to provide an effective program designed to</span></p>

       <ul>
         <li className="li3"><span className="s1">Build character,</span></li>
         <li className="li3"><span className="s1">Train in the responsibilities of citizenship, and</span></li>
         <li className="li3"><span className="s1">Develop personal fitness.</span></li>
       </ul>
       <p className="p3">&nbsp;</p>
       <p className="p3"><span className="s1">This is done through a program that is under the direction of boy leadership.</span></p>
       <p className="p3">&nbsp;</p>
       <p className="p3"><span className="s1">Troop 51 is a unique Scout Troop and it is a privilege to be a member of this Troop. As a result, there are numerous requirements attached to membership and much is expected of its scouts and their parents.</span></p>
       <p className="p3">&nbsp;</p>
       <p className="p3"><span className="s1">Troop 51 began its history in 1916. The international Scouting Movement was only nine years old when the Proctor Academy organized Troop 1 on March 12 1916, under the leadership of Scoutmaster Coleman Harzler. The Academy and Troop 1 were phased out of existence about three years later when public secondary schools became available in Provo.</span></p>
       <p className="p3">&nbsp;</p>
       <p className="p3"><span className="s1">In March of 1921 the Community Congregational Church was charted to operate Troop 11 under Rev. Ellis V. Kuhns. The period from 1925 until 1938 was governed by the strong traditional influence of John Gessford. The Troop excelled in all of the basic scout skill areas and was strongly visible in community service. During the depression the Troop remained active and uniformed.</span></p>
       <p className="p3"><span className="s1">When World War II began the Troop suffered laps on paper, though it continued to meet during the war years. In October of 1948 it lapsed again for four months, but was rebuilt by a concerned congregation and a new young Scoutmaster, Floyd Sampson.</span></p>
       <p className="p3"><span className="s1">With the growth of the troop in numbers, and future growth anticipated, on May 25, 2013, Troop 51 moved it&rsquo;s charter to the Elks Lodge in Provo.</span></p>
       <p className="p5">&nbsp;</p>
       <p className="p3"><span className="s1">Since then the Troop has maintained a proud individual and Troop record in Utah County and Utah National Parks Council. Troop 51 has been with Scouting and the Council since their infancies when Provo had dirt streets. Troop 51 has had four homes, four numbers, over 30 Scoutmasters and over 85 Eagles, hundreds of volunteers helpers, and thousands of young men; during its proud history.</span></p>
       <p className="p5">&nbsp;</p>
       <p className="p3"><span className="s1">Troop 51 has a rich heritage of traditions and values that are just as important to scouting today as they were when they were first initiated. This booklet is your guide to many of those traditions. In Scouting there may be many different ways in which something can be done. However, in this Troop there are certain ways that we do them. You should make an effort to learn them.</span></p>
