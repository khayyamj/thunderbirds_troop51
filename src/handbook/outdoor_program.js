        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">The Troop Leadership Council will plan Campouts. The Troop will go and operate as Patrols. In addition to a week-long Summer Camp, the Troop will try to go on one campout or have another activity every month.&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">A Scout must be signed up and paid in order to participate in troop activities.

        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Each Scout must obey the Scout Oath, Law and Outdoor code while participating in Troop activities. The appropriate Scout Leader will deal with any conduct that is unbecoming of a Scout. This may include being sent home early at parent&rsquo;s expense.</span></p>
        <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p3"><span className="s1"><strong>The Outdoor Code</strong></span></p>
        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Troop 51 abides by the outdoor code found in in the scout handbook. A campsite should always be left better than it was when we arrived.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The Troop participates in &ldquo;leave no trace and tread lightly programs&rdquo; camping.&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p className="p3"><span className="s1"><strong>Campouts</strong></span></p>
        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Scouts are required to be in full uniform at all campouts unless otherwise noted. Scouts will arrive at the meeting place in Class B uniform. Flag ceremonies are conducted at each campout, and Scouts will be in Class A during the flag ceremony.</span></p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">For summer camps all Scouts and leaders will arrive in Class A uniform and will travel in className B.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p className="p9">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p3"><span className="s1"><strong>Food</strong></span></p>
        <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Generally, the Troop will plan, purchase and cook by Patrols. Patrol menus forms will be turned in for approval to the Senior Patrol Leader 2 weeks before the activity. </span></p>
        <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p3"><span className="s1"><strong>Meals</strong></span></p>
        <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Before each meal, the Troop will gather and have a &ldquo;meal prayer.&rdquo; The Troop uses the &ldquo;Philmont Grace.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>

        <p className="p3"><span className="s1"><strong>Money</strong></span></p>
        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">A Scout should not take large amounts of money with him on campouts. There is usually nowhere to spend it and it offers temptations to others</span></p>
        <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Overnight campout fee is $10.00 per scout. Two-night campouts are $15.00. If something other than a basic camp out or activity the cost may change. Money needs to be paid one week before the campout is nonrefundable and cannot be used on future campouts. If you choose to use money from your scout account for campouts you </span><span className="s3"><strong>MUST</strong></span><span className="s1"> let the Troop Committee treasure know a week prior to the campout.</span></p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">All scout fees need to be paid via PayPal.</span></p>
        <p className="p9">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p3"><span className="s1"><strong>Transportation</strong></span></p>
        <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Troop 51 participates in a large number of activities and campouts. Without transportation this would not be possible. Parental support is, therefore, necessary to help the Troop remain active. If there are not enough adults willing to provide transportation for activities or campouts, the event will be canceled. Food may not be eaten by Scouts in vehicles without the express permission of the driver/owner of the vehicle.</span></p>
        <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">When dropping a Scout off for an activity other than a regular Troop Meeting, the parent or guardian should check in with the scoutmaster in charge to make sure they have everything needed for the campout.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">At the end of a campout or other Scout activity, all vehicles must return to the Elks Lodge in Provo. We need to make sure we all make it home. No one will be allowed to leave until we are all accounted for and have been dismissed by the Senior Patrol Leader. Please make sure you are on time to pick up your scout.</span></p>
        <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p3"><span className="s1"><strong>Adult Leadership</strong></span></p>
        <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Current BSA guidelines require two-deep adult leadership at all Scouting activities. If two adults cannot be present, the event must be canceled.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>At least one adult must be over the age of 21 and all adults must have current Youth Protection training. Please do not drop your son off if there are not two adult leaders present. </span></p>
        <p className="p11"><span className="s1"><strong>Female Participation</strong></span></p>
        <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p11"><span className="s1">To ensure proper conduct BSA has stated:</span></p>
        <p className="p12">&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="p10"><span className="s5">1. </span><span className="s1">All Leaders are expected to reflect high moral standards established by customs,&nbsp;</span><span className="s1">traditional values, and religious teachings.</span></p>
        <p className="p10"><span className="s5">2. </span><span className="s1">Male and female leaders require separate sleeping facilities. Married couples&nbsp;</span><span className="s1">may share the same quarters if appropriate facilities are available.</span></p>
        <p className="p10"><span className="s5">3. </span><span className="s1">Male and female youth participants will not share the same sleeping facility.</span></p>
        <p className="p5"><span className="s5">4. </span><span className="s1">When staying in tents, no youth will stay in the tent of an adult.</span></p>
        <p className="p10"><span className="s5">5. </span><span className="s1">If housing other than a tent is used, separate housing must be provided for both&nbsp;</span><span className="s1">male and female participants. Adult male leaders must provide leadership for the&nbsp;</span><span className="s1">female participants.</span></p>
        <p className="p10"><span className="s5">6. </span><span className="s1">Adult leaders need to respect the privacy of youth members in situations where&nbsp;</span><span className="s1">the youth are changing clothes or taking showers and intrude only to the extent&nbsp;</span><span className="s1">that health and safety requires. Adults also need to protect their own privacy in&nbsp;</span><span className="s1">similar situations.</span></p>
        <p className="p10"><span className="s5">7. </span><span className="s1">Although it is not mandatory, Councils are strongly encouraged to have separate</span><span className="s1"><span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>shower and latrine facilities for females and males. In camps where separate&nbsp;</span><span className="s1">facilities are not available, separate shower schedules for males and females&nbsp;</span><span className="s1">should be posted. Use the buddy system for the latrine by having one person&nbsp;</span><span className="s1">wait outside the entrance, or use &ldquo;occupied&rdquo; and &ldquo;unoccupied&rdquo; signs on door&nbsp;</span><span className="s1">latches.</span></p>
          <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
          <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Written parent or guardian approval is required for each female participant or guest of either sex under age 18. In the event a female is participating in an overnight activity there must be either another female participant of a parent, guardian, or spouse related to said participant.</span></p>
          <p className="p9">&nbsp;</p>
          <p className="p3"><span className="s1"><strong>Special Family Campout</strong></span></p>
          <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
          <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Occasionally the Troop will have a special campout where the families of the Scouts will be invited to attend. Scouts will still camp and cook as patrols. Adults and guest families will camp and cook together. </span></p>
