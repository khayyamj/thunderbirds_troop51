      <p className="p3"><span className="s1"><strong>Joining</strong></span></p>
      <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
      <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Membership in Troop 51 is not a right! It is a privilege given to those individuals who are willing to make the appropriate effort to contribute to an effective program.</span></p>
      <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
      <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Any boy wishing to join Troop 51 will be a probationary member of the troop for the first three weeks.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>He may participate with the Troop (except for campouts) but is not required to register or obtain a uniform. He will be a guest at the meeting.</span></p>
      <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
      <p className="p5"><span className="s1">At the end of this period, he will become a formal member of the Troop once he has filled out his registration and paid registration fees.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>A Scout Handbook and Troop neckerchief will be issued to him along with a Troop guidebook.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>He will then have two additional meetings to obtain his own full uniform. He may now participate fully in all Troop functions.</span></p>
      <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
      <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Troop dues of $60 are due twice a year at the beginning of April and October.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>If a boy joins the Troop other than at the beginning of the year he will pay a pro-rated share of the Troop dues upon joining.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Any adult wishing to have a leadership position is required to pay the current Adult registration fee that is due by November 1</span><span className="s2"><sup>st</sup></span><span className="s1">. </span></p>
      <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
      <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Every new Scout must turn in an application or transfer to the Advancement Coordinator.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>It is the responsibility of the new Scout to produce documented evidence of rank advancements, merit badges, and other honors claimed. All transfers must also go through a Board of Review to qualify for the Troop.</span></p>
      <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
      <p className="p3"><span className="s1"><strong>Multiple (Dual) Registrations</strong></span></p>
      <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
      <p className="p5"><span className="s1">Some boys may wish to register with Troop 51 and still be active in another Troop. This is especially common for boys who have another troop with a religious affiliation. In this case, they can register in both troops. If you are dually registered, we require that you make Troop 51 your primary troop that all Scout Master Conferences and Board of Reviews will take place. Please provide us with the other Troop number. </span></p>
      <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
      <p className="p5"><span className="s1">This is how it works:</span></p>
      <p className="p5"><span className="s1">You register with Troop 51 and then the Troop 51 Advancement Coordinator registers you with your other troop. This will avoid any confusion with the Boy Scouts as to how the boy is registered. This will allow you to participate with both troops but have all awards and rank advancement go through Troop 51.</span></p>
      <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
      <p className="p3"><span className="s1"><strong>Leaving</strong></span></p>
      <p className="p4">&nbsp;</p>
      <p className="p5"><span className="s1">A Scout moving to another location should notify the Scout Master &amp;/or Committee Chair. On receipt of such a request, the Quartermaster and Librarian will check their records to determine if the Scout has any materials that need to be turned in. All items including Troop Neckerchief must be returned at least one week prior to leaving. The Troop Advancement Chairman will also be contacted so that a record of Scout activity can be prepared and sent to the new Troop. If the Scout has not earned his Eagle through Troop 51 then a Troop vote will be taken to determine if he can retain his Troop Neckerchief.</span></p>
      <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
      <p className="p3"><span className="s1"><strong>Parent Participation</strong></span></p>
      <p className="p6">&nbsp;</p>
      <p className="p5"><span className="s1">In order to receive accurate and up to date information regarding Troop 51 activities, it is pertinent to attend the quarterly parents meeting. This is an area that makes Troop 51 unique &ndash; parent involvement in the Troop. In fact, the success of Troop 51&rsquo;s program depends on the combined efforts of both the Scouts and their parents/guardians. All new parents are required to attend a new parent orientation meeting and complete youth protection. </span></p>

      <p className="p3"><span className="s1"><strong>Troop Committee Elections</strong></span></p>
